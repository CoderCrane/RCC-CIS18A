Comments: I enjoyed the challenge of creating a sorting method with only if else statements, and I've improved my coding skills from such practice in this assignment.
	  As recommended by the book, I planned out the code ahead of time on paper with an initialization, processing, and termination phase.  This strategy resulted 
	  in a much faster time of completion.
